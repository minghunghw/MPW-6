# AXI Memory Interface

This unit provides a bridge between the AXI bus and a simple memory interface
that is commonly found in SRAMs.

There are two versions of this IP:

- DP: Dual-Port Version, two AXI ports are multiplexed to one memory interface
- SP: Single-Port Version, just one AXI port is used to access one memory interface
